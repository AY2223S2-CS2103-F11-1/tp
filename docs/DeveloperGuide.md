### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("rm 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `rm 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person`, `Consultation`, `Tutorial`, `Lab` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList`, `UniqueConsultationList`, `UniqueTutorialList`, `UniqueLabList` objects respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Tutorial` objects (e.g., results of a filter / sort query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Tutorial>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Consultation` objects (e.g., results of a filter / sort query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Consultation>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Lab` objects (e.g., results of a filter / sort query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Lab>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)
* It might seem strange at first as to why can Tutorial, Lab and Consultation exist without students. How can a Tutorial or Lab or Consultation be conducted without students in the first place? That is because the purpose of our application is to remind TAs that they are supposed to attend an event. During the event itself, the TA will add students to the event for attendance taking.
* Thereafter, the TA will be able to edit the performance (score) of the student for the event related task.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>
<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Event` abstract class in the `AddressBook`, which `Tutorial` inherits from.<br>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Event` abstract class in the `AddressBook`, which `Consultation` inherits from.<br>
<img src="images/BetterConsultationClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### \[Proposed\] Event feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) mechanism for events is facilitated by `Event`, `Tutorial`, `Lab`, `Consultation`. The Teaching Assistant (TA) using the application will be able to:

* Add a tutorial which will be saved in the current address book state in its history.
* Delete a tutorial which will be saved in the current address book state in its history.
* Edit a tutorial which will be saved in the current address book state in its history.

* Add a lab which will be saved in the current address book state in its history.
* Delete a lab which will be saved in the current address book state in its history.
* Edit a lab which will be saved in the current address book state in its history.

* Add a consultation which will be saved in the current address book state in its history.
* Delete a consultation which will be saved in the current address book state in its history.
* Edit a consultation which will be saved in the current address book state in its history.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a TA executes an add event.
Do take note that whether the event is recurring or not is included as well:

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a TA executes an edit event:

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a TA executes an add student to event:

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a TA executes an edit student in event:

<img src="images/TrAcker-activity-diagrams/EditStudentInEventActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a TA executes an delete student from event:

<img src="images/TrAcker-activity-diagrams/DeleteStudentFromEventActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How CRUD (non-recurring) events executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save Tutorial, Lab and Consultation as separate events.
    * Pros: Easy to implement, better abstraction.
    * Cons: More memory since more code is written.

* **Alternative 2:** Combine all the Tutorial, Lab and Consultations in an event, and check whether it is Tutorial, Lab or Consultation based on the title or command.
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory since less code is written,
    * Cons: Involves checking the content of the event such as the title, which does not obey to Software Principles.

**Aspect: How CRUD (recurring) events executes:**

* **1:** Increments Tutorial, Lab and Consultation only by date.
    * Pros: Ensures consistency and no duplicates due to mishandled / unhandles cases.
    * Cons: There can be a recurring event based by name. For example, the head TA can be in charge of multiple tutorials occurring at the same time,
  but TrAcker does not allow this since only one event can occur during a period of time (i.e. no timing overlap of events ).
  
  
This implementation can be overcome in future versions by allowing TrAcker to warn the TA of overlapping timings and the TA agreeing to it. This will involve
  a lot of cases which is why it is not allowed for now.

### Add Students to Events feature

#### Current Implementation

The current Add Students to Events (addStudent) feature is facilitated by the `Event` subclasses as well as the `ModelManager` and `AddressBook` classes.

The addStudent feature implements the following operations:
* `Event#addStudent(Person student)` Adds the student to the event that the method is called from. Adds the student into the Event's student list, implemented as List<Person>.
* `AddressBook#addStudentToTutorial(Person toAdd, Index index)` Adds toAdd to the Tutorial in `index` of the tutorial list.
* `AddressBook#addStudentToLab(Person toAdd, Index index)` Adds toAdd to the Lab in `index` of the lab list.
* `AddressBook#addStudentToConsultation(Person toAdd, Index index)` Adds toAdd to the Consultation in `index` of the consultation list.
* `Model#addStudentToTutorial(Index toAdd, Index index)` Adds the student at index toAdd in the AddressBook's Person list to the Tutorial in `index` of the tutorial list.
* `Model#addStudenttoLab(Index toAdd, Index index)` Adds the student at index toAdd in the AddressBook's Person list to the Lab in `index` of the lab list.
* `Model#addStudentToConsultation(Index toAdd, Index index)` Adds the student at index toAdd in the AddressBook's Person list to the Consultation in `index` of the consultation list.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface and `AddressBook` class. The `Event#addStudent(Person student)` operation is also implemented in all `Event` subclasses.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the addStudent mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialised to be empty.

Step 2. The user executes `add n/James Ho telegram/22224444 e/jamesho@example.com a/123, Clementi Rd, 1234665 score/1` to add a student.

Step 3. The user executes `touch Tutorial/tut` to add an Event.

Step 4. The user executes `addStudent 1 Tutorial/1` to add the first student in the Person list into the tutorial at first index of the tutorial list. 

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a TA executes an add student to event:

<img src="images/TrAcker-activity-diagrams/AddStudentToEventActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the command input is structured**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Chooses the student from a list of students.
    * Pros: Do not have to fill in all student details for every addStudent command.
    * Cons: May be difficult to find student when total student size gets big.

* **Alternative 2:** Enter student details for every addStudent command.
    * Pros: Do not have to maintain a student list (can get messy with lots of students)
    * Cons: More troublesome to key in 1 student to multiple Events compared to Alternative 1.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Delete Operation for Students within Event

#### Current Implementation

The proposed mechanism is facilitated by the `Event` subclasses as well as the `ModelManager` and `AddressBook` classes.

The deleteStudent feature makes use of the existing operation:
* `Event#removeIndexStudent(int Index)` Deletes the student at `index` of the caller event's student list.

The deleteStudent feature implements/ the following operations:
* `AddressBook#deleteStudentFromEvent(Index toDel, Index eventIndex, String type)` Deletes student at index `toDel` from the student list of the event at index `eventIndex` of the event list with type `type`.
* `Model#deleteStudentFromEvent(Index toDel, Index eventIndex, String eventType)` Calls `AddressBook#deleteStudentFromEvent(Index toDel, Index eventIndex, String type)`. 

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface and `AddressBook` class.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The user has already used the application before and has an `Event` established with a non-empty student list.

Step 2. The user executes `deleteStudent 1 Tutorial/1` to delete the student at index 1 (1-based) of the student list of the tutorial at index 1 (1-based) of the `Tutorial` list.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a TA executes an delete student from event:

<img src="images/TrAcker-activity-diagrams/DeleteStudentFromEventActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

#### Design considerations:

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_


### \[Proposed\] Help feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed Help feature expands on the default Help feature available in AB3. Instead of displaying the UserGuide URL
and asking the user to visit the webpage to view the commands, this new Help feature will display the commands in the
result box. This facilitates the user's usage by providing easy in-app reference instead of having to refer to an
external window. Switch-Case will be used to identify subsequent commands and parse() method will be implemented
for helps with deeper abstractions.

<img src="images/TrAcker-activity-diagrams/HelpActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

As seen from the Activity diagram above, Help is split into 3 categories: Student, Event and Sort/Filter(Organisation).

#### Usage Example

Command chaining will be used for this feature. Upon entering `help` into the command box, the 3 categories will be displayed.
To choose the desired category, user will have to chain down the command by entering `help event`. Subsequently
`help event lab` to access Lab related helps.

#### Design Considerations

Why Command Chaining was used?

PROS
* Seasoned users will be able to pinpoint the help they require in the future in 1 command
* Specific syntax will be displayed instead of displaying everything and letting the user find themselves
* Helps fresh users by "starting simple" by requiring just single 'help' and allows them to dive deeper if they so desire

CONS
* User will have to type quite a bit

#### Possible Updates

Commands may be abstracted deeper if the displayed syntaxes were deemed too overwhelming. This will definitely require 
more typing from the user and deeper abstraction will be carefully considered to see if it is really necessary.

### \[Proposed\] Filter feature

#### Proposed Implementation

After the user types "/filter [group] [criteria] [threshold]" and clicks "enter", our system will parse the input given
and detect that it is a "filter" command that is being called.

1. Depending on the "[group]" typed by the user, our system goes to the AddressBook in storage and
   accesses the relevant Unique[group]List. For example, if the desired group is the "tutorial" group,
   then "UniqueTutorialList" will be accessed to iterate through the people in that group.

2. Our system iterates through each Person object in the list and creates a new list that only stores
   People objects whose criteria value is below the given threshold.

3. Our system finally displays all the Person objects in the form of a table to the user.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

Todo: add clean image of activity diagram

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Iterates through the existing list and manually filters the desired ones.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Takes up extra space.

* **Alternative 2:** Uses the previously implemented 'sort' method and set visibility of people whose criteria
  is lower than threshold to be 0% (hide them from view))
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less space and uses previously implemented code for abstraction.
    * Cons: May mutate the list unncessarily or introduce bugs if visibility for hidden rows is not reset to 100%.

### \[Proposed\] Note feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) mechanism for notes is facilitated by `add note`, `list note`, `delete note`, and `edit note`. The Teaching Assistant (TA) using the application will be able to:

* Add a new note to an event which will be saved in the corresponding event's current address book state in its history.
* List all notes for an event which are saved in the corresponding event's current address book state in its history.
* Delete a note for an event which is saved in the corresponding event's current address book state in its history.
* Edit/Update a note for an event which is saved in the corresponding event's current address book state in its history.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a TA executes a note-related command.

<img src="images/TrAcker-activity-diagrams/NoteActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

#### Usage Example

Notes can be added, edited, or deleted from events through `add-note`, `edit-note`, and `rm-note` commands.
Notes are only associated with events. Whenever an event is deleted, its linked notes are erased as well. And when a new event 
is created, empty note list will be created and up to 20 notes can be added to a single event (not counting deleted ones).

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How CRUD notes executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make note an attribute of event objects, and updates to notes are executed at the event level.
    * Pros: Easier to manage a list of notes and design the GUI.
    * Cons: Less flexible with individual note operation such as note merges.

* **Alternative 2:** Make note object parallel with event and reference event from notes.
    * Pros: Harder to manage a list objects and cause additional memory overhead.
    * Cons: Easier to sort notes based on event dates.
