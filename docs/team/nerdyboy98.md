### Project: TrAcker

TrAcker - TrAcker is a desktop event management application for NUS CS2040 Teaching Assitants (TA). The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to request help in the app and learn about the syntax.
  * What it does: allows the user to quickly narrow down to the input syntax they want to know and quickly start using the app.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now get help inside the app itself instead of having to refer to the UG on an external webpage.
  * Highlights: 
    * Since the syntax to be used is displayed in the output box right below the input box, users can easily follow rather than scrolling around in the UserGuide to find the syntax the user wants to know. 
    * Help is divided into 3 different categories: Student, Event  & Organisation, and this reduces the clutter of displaying every single syntax available.
    * Syntaxes displayed are aligned vertically to enable better reading and makes the displayed texts less overwhelming

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://github.com/nerdyboy98/tp)

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the existing help button to display 'User Guide' rather than 'Help' to better explain what the buttons does (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())

* **Documentation Contributions**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the `help` feature
    * Ensured that the syntaxes in the UserGuide and syntaxes displayed in the app are indifferent
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the `help` feature.

* **Community**:
  * Suggested several intuitive command words to make certain feature's command word easier to remember (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
  * Helped teammates test the usability of the UserGuide by trying out the syntaxes listed there and reporting any bug/discrepancies
  * Helped to test the User Interface after modification to ensure that images and boxes do not go out of alignment

* _{you can add/remove categories in the list above}_
